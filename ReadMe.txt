In the g12-2 after the enter is pressed some random stuffs are shown and then error is shown so we kept the main code in another file named g12-1. In this following game due to our lack of time we couldn't complete 100%. The connection between the basket and ball couldn't be given completely so the score couldn't be displayed nor taken. As mention the ball has only 3 lives. after reaching the end of the screen without any hit it looses a life and eventually the game gets over. If space is pressed the ball moves and with or without enter pressed the basket moves
